# Allez - Multi-language dev app launcher

Allez (pronounced aah-lay) is a command-line tool to launch local web apps
written in just about any language. To start an application, simply navigate 
to the app directory and type `allez`. This will start the server on 
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:80) by default.

**NOTE:** This is still very new. I've only spent a couple hours on it so far, 
but I will improve upon it in the future. Feel free to submit a pull request 
if you'd like to contribute. Some long-term goals for the project:

* Install runtime environments and servers by running `allez install`
* Language version manager integration (rvm/rbenv, nvm, etc.)
* Additional languages: Python, Java, Go, Erlang
* Auto-create *.dev domains a la Pow
* Add tests

## Options

* `--port=<number>`, `-p <number>` Specify a different port number
* `--dir=<app dir>`, `-d <app dir>` Specify an app directory other than the current working directory

## Supported languages

* **PHP** - Allez looks for an index.php file (currently requires PHP 5.4)
* **Ruby/Rack** - Allez looks for a config.ru file
* **Node** - Allez looks for app.js or server.js files
* **Static** - All other types will currently be served as static files. This allows you to serve static
  sites through a development server easily
* More coming soonâ€¦

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:okalex/allez.git
cd allez
gem build allez.gemspec
gem install ./allez-0.0.1.gem
```

**NOTE:** This will be added to rubygems soon.
